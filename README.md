# School District Analysis

## Overview of the school district analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
Maria asked me to re-analyze the school districts test scores after the first analysis showed evidence of 9th grade math and reading scores being falsified. The following analysis will report on how removing the falsified scores affected the overall analysis of math and reading test scores for the district, schools, and grade levels.

## Results: 

### - How is the district summary affected?
### - How is the school summary affected?

### - How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
## - How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
### Math and reading scores by grade
### Scores by school spending
