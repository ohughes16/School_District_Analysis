# School District Analysis

## Overview of the school district analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
Maria asked me to re-analyze the school districts test scores after the first analysis showed evidence of 9th grade math and reading scores being falsified. The following analysis will report on how removing the falsified scores affected the overall analysis of math and reading test scores for the district, schools, and grade levels.

## Results: 

### - How is the district summary affected?

As you can see in the above before and after visualizations of the district summary, there was no change after removing the 9th grade Thomas High School math and reading scores. Thomas High School is a Charter school, so we would be looking for an increase or decrease in the passing percentages, or average scores for the Charter Schools.
